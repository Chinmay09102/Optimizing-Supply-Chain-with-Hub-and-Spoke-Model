# Optimizing-Supply-Chain-with-Hub-and-Spoke-Model
The project delves into the application of the hub-and-spoke model for enhancing cost efficiency in a manufacturing unit's supply chain network. The project explores four transportation scenarios, considering both low and high demand from source to sink nodes, with and without intermediate hubs. Mathematical formulations and constraints are meticulously detailed, utilizing variables such as goods shipped, goods stored, and goods shipped from hubs, along with binary variables for hub presence. The GAMS solver is employed for numerical experimentation, yielding optimal solutions for each scenario. The results demonstrate that the hub-and-spoke configuration consistently outperforms the non-centralized system in terms of minimizing transportation costs and enhancing overall supply chain performance. The project concludes by emphasizing the adaptability and effectiveness of the hub-and-spoke model in optimizing resource utilization and reducing operational costs across diverse industries. References to influential works in operations research and linear programming literature complement the project's robust analytical framework.
